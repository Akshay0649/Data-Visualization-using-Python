# Data-Visualization-using-Python

# This Notebook explores the "tips" dataset from the Seaborn library. 

# Performed the following analyses:

# - Visualized the relationship between total bill and tip amount, considering gender differences.
# - Explored the relationship between tip amount, total bill, and table size.
# - Used Seaborn's lmplot to visualize the trend and potential linear relationship between tip and total bill.
# - Created histograms to show the distribution of total bill amounts.
# - Utilized Seaborn's histplot with kernel density estimation to visualize the distribution of tip amounts.
# - Analyzed tip amounts by time and day of the week, using bar plots and stacked bar charts.
# - Employed Seaborn's lmplot to visualize the relationship between total bill and tip amount, considering gender and time of day.
# - Created histograms to show the distribution of tip amounts and total bill amounts.

# This notebook provides insights into tipping patterns based on factors like gender, time of day, and total bill amount. 
# The visualizations help understand the distribution of these variables and potential relationships between them.
